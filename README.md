# MATLAB
I am trying to debug this code and I need help. The objective of the script is to determine the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature given experimental temperature vs time data from 5 points within a material. Each point is equally spaced out by 1 centimeter. The density is assumed constant and is 1380 kg/m^3 and the specific heat is 983 J/(kg*K). Addtionally, a "guess" for the thermal conductivity is included in the form of a second order polynomial with coefficients a, b, and c. a = 1.187*10^-6, b = -0.0012649, and c = 0.87 for the initial guess (k = aT^2+bT+c, where k is the thermal conductivity and T is temperature). The code is supposed to use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find new coefficients for the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature, but when I run the code, I get results nothing close to answer. Ideally, predicted temperatures using the ever-updating thermal conductivity should continue to align with the experimental temperatures until they converge when a tolerance is met. It seems the code will run until convergence, but like I said, the final result is not accurate. I have attached all the necessary files to run this yourself.
